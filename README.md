An, unifinished, blackjack web game, to put my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills in action.<br>
Problems to be fixed:
- no Double method
- no Split method
- no Insurance method
- no Help section
- no RWD
- no animation and sound
- site looks pretty basic and ugly
- minor other bugs
- code optimization
- probably some more missing stuff I do not recall
